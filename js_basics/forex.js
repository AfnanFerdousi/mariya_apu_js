// print multiplication table of any number

const number = 3;

for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++){    
    console.log(`${number} X ${i} = ${number * i}`)
    // console.log(i*3, "i am string i*3")
}
// BOTH string and dynamic value
// 3 X 1 = 3
// 3 X 2 = 6
// .....








// i++ means increasing the value of i by 1.
// i-- means decreasing the value of i by 1. 
// i += 1 or any number, for example i += 2, i += 5 means adding 5 to i's value. which you could also write as

// i = i + the number

// REASSIGN means CHANGING the value of the variable
// REDECLARE means CREATING a new variable with a VARIABLE NAME that already EXISTS
